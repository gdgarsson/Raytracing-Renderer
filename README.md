# Raytracing-Renderer
 C++ .ppm image renderer using raytracing to populate pixels.
 
 Hello! This is a computer graphics demo that I worked on during Autumn 2021. Its a 
 very simple project; using the raytracing graphics rendering algorithm, I made a program 
 that renders an image in the .ppm image format. For your convenience, I do have a snippet 
 of what the final product looks like (the FOV is set to 70 and each Ray can reflect/refract
 a maximum of 5 times). See: [RTXDemo1.jpeg](https://github.com/gdgarsson/Raytracing-Renderer/blob/main/RTXDemo1.jpeg). <br><br>

 If you want to see more of my work, please check out my [website](https://www.gdgarsson.com). 
 Additionally, I'm currently working on recreating this project and upgrading it with Vulkan, 
 so be on the lookout for that. I've got plenty of more work on the way. 
 
 Have a great day!
